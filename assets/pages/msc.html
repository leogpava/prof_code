        <p>Only way to feel the noise is when it's good and loud <br>
            So good I can't believe it, screaming with the crowd<br>
            Don't sweat it, we'll get it back to you<br>
            Don't sweat it, we'll get it back to you<br>
            Overkill, overkill, overkill<br>
            On your feet you feel the beat, it goes straight to your spine<br>
            Shake your head you must be dead if it don't make you fly<br>
            Don't sweat it, we'll get it back to you<br>
            Don't sweat it, we'll get it back to you<br>
            Overkill, overkill, overkill<br>
            Know your body's made to move, ya feel it in your guts<br>
            Rock 'n' roll ain't worth the name if it don't make ya strut<br>
            Don't sweat it, we'll get it back to you<br>
            Don't sweat it, we'll get it back to you<br>
            Overkill, overkill, overkill</p>

        <p>Lie back and dream of me<br>
            Red death to set you free<br>
            We turn the screws to make you die<br>
            Soft flesh and razor blades<br>
            Golgotha, ace of spades<br>
            Steel needles kiss your pretty eyes<br>
            All mine, all mine, black night, moonshine<br>
            All mine, all mine, nightmare, the dreamtime<br>
            Black terror stalks the night<br>
            Claws to clutch and fangs to bite<br>
            A dark and faceless crawling fear<br>
            Despair, you can't resist<br>
            Now the lizard's kiss<br>
            The reptile hisses in your ear<br>
            All mine, all mine, black night, moonshine<br>
            All mine, all mine, nightmare, the dreamtime<br>
            Dead voices speak through me<br>
            Of things that should not be<br>
            The prince of wounds, the lord of flies<br>
            Evil within ourselves<br>
            We need nobody else<br>
            We tell ourselves the best of lies<br>
            All mine, all mine, black night, moonshine<br>
            All mine, all mine, nightmare, the dreamtime<br>
            Nightmare, the dreamtime</p>

        <p>If you like to gamble, I tell you I'm your man<br>
            You win some, lose some, it's all the same to me<br>
            The pleasure is to play, makes no difference what you say<br>
            I don't share your greed, the only card I need is<br>
            <br>
            The Ace of Spades<br>
            The Ace of Spades<br>
            <br>
            Playing for the high one, dancing with the Devil<br>
            Going with the flow, it's all a game to me<br>
            Seven or eleven, snake eyes watching you<br>
            Double up or quit, double strike or split<br>
            <br>
            The Ace of Spades<br>
            The Ace of Spades<br>
            <br>
            You know I'm born to lose, and gambling is for fools<br>
            But that's the way I like it baby<br>
            I don't wanna live forever<br>
            And don't forget the Joker<br>
            <br>
            Pushing up the ante, I know you gotta see me<br>
            Read 'em and weep, the dead man's hand again<br>
            I see it in your eyes, take one look and die<br>
            The only thing you see, you know it's gonna be<br>
            <br>
